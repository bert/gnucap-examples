Networks of Resistors and Sources

The previous example covers enough concepts to model arbitrarily complex
networks of resistors and sources. These are essentially linear circuits
that have no relation to time. A more elaborate example is presented below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NETWORK OF RESISTORS AND VOLTAGE SOURCES

V1 2 1 10
V2 4 3 5
V3 0 3 3
R1 1 2 220
R2 2 3 4.7k
R3 4 5 3k3
R4 3 5 10k
R5 0 1 22k
R6 0 5 15k
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Run this with:

	gnucap -b eg2.ckt
	print dc v(1) v(2) v(3) v(4) v(5)
	dc
	quit

Note that this is about the limit of what can be done with these two
components. Other components that offer further possibilities are
the current source (any component with a name that begins with ``I''
is a current source) and the dependent sources:

	first letter 	output 	input
	of name 	type 	type
	-----------------------------------------
	E		voltage	voltage
	F		current	current
	G		current	voltage
	H		voltage	current
	-----------------------------------------

Each of these has a gain value expressing the relation between its
output and its input and they allow the modeling of linear amplifiers
and other such devices. As mentioned above, none of these components
understand time nor can they be used to represent a nonlinear device.
Thus, any network constructed from the components that have been seen
so far will be reducible to a Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit
when considered from the point of view of one particular node and the
ground node 0.
