Networks of Resistors and Sources

The previous example covers enough concepts to model arbitrarily complex
networks of resistors and sources. These are essentially linear circuits
that have no relation to time. A more elaborate example is presented below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NETWORK OF RESISTORS AND VOLTAGE SOURCES

V1 2 1 10
V2 4 3 5
V3 0 3 3
R1 1 2 220
R2 2 3 4.7k
R3 4 5 3k3
R4 3 5 10k
R5 0 1 22k
R6 0 5 15k
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Run this with:

	gnucap -b eg2.ckt
	print dc v(1) v(2) v(3) v(4) v(5)
	dc
	quit

Note that this is about the limit of what can be done with these two
components.
